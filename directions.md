# GitHub Tutorial Project

## _Overview_

## _Directions_

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Notice there are two files:  
    a. `README.md` is where you will find a template to use as a starting point for your tutorial.  This is where you'll do your work.  
    b. `directions.md` is where you will find these directions.
3. As you edit, make a commit every once in a while.  Don't forget to push!

### A note about plagiarism
You should be typing _every single word_.  It is ok to refer to your notes, the slides, the internet, and even your classmates for help.  However, **intellectual property is to be regarded highly in this class**.  You should be explaining everything in your own words.  If you are copying/pasting, you are not learning.

### Assumptions
Should you assume your reader is a student at HSTAT?  Should you assume they already have a cloud9 account?  It is _up to you_ to decide what assumptions you will make.  But perhaps the best strategy is to speak to all audiences with hints for HSTAT/c9  
i.e. making a Github account:
> Choose a username (if you are a student at HSTAT, use your HSTAT email, but without the `@hstat.org`).

or SSH key:
> Get the SSH key from your IDE (if you're using cloud9, here's how to find it...)

### Final thoughts
The best way to learn something is through repeated practice.  
Feel free to **practice** all of these concepts on your own to understand them better.
