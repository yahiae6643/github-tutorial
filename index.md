# GitHub Tutorial Project

## _Overview_  

* Using markdown syntax, display all of your knowledge about **Git** and **Github** in a single README file.  

## _Directions_

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Notice there are two files:  
    a. `README.md` is where you will find a template to use as a starting point for your tutorial.  This is where you'll do your work.  
    b. `directions.md` is where you will find these directions.
3. As you edit, make a commit every once in a while.  Don't forget to push!  
4. When you are finished, submit your remote repository URL (see class website).

### A note about plagiarism
You should be typing _every single word_.  It is ok to refer to your notes, the slides, the internet, and even your classmates for help.  However, **intellectual property is to be regarded highly in this class**.  You should be explaining everything in your own words.  If you are copying/pasting, you are not learning.

### Final thoughts
The best way to learn something is through repeated practice.  
Feel free to **practice** all of these concepts on your own to understand them better.  
Don't forget to use [Google](http://www.google.com) if you get stuck!
